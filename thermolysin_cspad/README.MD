Four indexable images from cxi78513, run 14 (thermolysin). See Hattne et al. 2014, [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1038/nmeth.2887-blue.svg)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2887)

Metrology was re-determined using `cspad.cbf_metrology`. These four images were indexable after metrology refinement.
CBFs were generated from the XTC streams using `cctbx.xfel.xtc_process`.
