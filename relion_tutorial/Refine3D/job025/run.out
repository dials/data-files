 Auto-refine: Estimated accuracy angles= 19.565 degrees; offsets= 9.46466 Angstroms
 Auto-refine: WARNING: The angular accuracy is worse than 10 degrees, so basically you cannot align your particles (yet)!
 Auto-refine: WARNING: You probably need not worry if the accuracy improves during the next few iterations.
 Auto-refine: WARNING: However, if the problem persists it may lead to spurious FSC curves, so be wary of inflated resolution estimates...
 Auto-refine: WARNING: Sometimes it is better to tune resolution yourself by adjusting T in a 3D-classification with a single class.

 Auto-refine: Refinement has converged, stopping now... 
 Auto-refine: + Final reconstruction from all particles is saved as: Refine3D/job025/run_class001.mrc
 Auto-refine: + Final model parameters are stored in: Refine3D/job025/run_model.star
 Auto-refine: + Final data parameters are stored in: Refine3D/job025/run_data.star
 Auto-refine: + Final resolution (without masking) is: 3.88371
 Auto-refine: + But you may want to run relion_postprocess to mask the unfil.mrc maps and calculate a higher resolution FSC
