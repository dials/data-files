 Auto-refine: Estimated accuracy angles= 12.145 degrees; offsets= 6.30086 Angstroms
 Auto-refine: WARNING: The angular accuracy is worse than 10 degrees, so basically you cannot align your particles (yet)!
 Auto-refine: WARNING: You probably need not worry if the accuracy improves during the next few iterations.
 Auto-refine: WARNING: However, if the problem persists it may lead to spurious FSC curves, so be wary of inflated resolution estimates...
 Auto-refine: WARNING: Sometimes it is better to tune resolution yourself by adjusting T in a 3D-classification with a single class.
