Integrated data derived from two 1° wedges, each of ten 0.1° images.
These data were generated with xia2 and DIALS (May 2020, master) from the first ten images of each of the first two sweeps of the DIALS small molecule tutorial data set, `l_cyst_01` and `l_cyst_02` [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.51405.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.51405).
 * `11_integrated.{expt,refl}` — the integrated data from the first ten `l_cyst_01` images.
 * `23_integrated.{expt,refl}` — the integrated data from the first ten `l_cyst_02` images.
